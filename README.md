# Healthcare-Analytics-and-Prediction-For-Stroke

Project Overview
Welcome to the Healthcare-Analytics-For-Stroke repository! This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stroke risk using a comprehensive healthcare dataset. The dataset includes various patient features such as age, gender, glucose levels, body mass index (BMI), and more, which are critical for understanding stroke outcomes. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights and predictive capabilities to improve stroke risk management and healthcare interventions.

Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast the likelihood of stroke based on patient data. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we identify key features and trends associated with stroke risk. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Additionally, we evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure reliable predictions.

Technologies Used
This project utilizes a range of technologies and tools to achieve its objectives. Key technologies include:

Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and model development.
Pandas and NumPy: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and documentation
